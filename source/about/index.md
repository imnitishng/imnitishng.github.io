# It Me Guiz 
### Forewarning: Going full informal here
Hello I am Nitish, here is a good photo of me (IMO) from my last trip to Lansdowne, take a moment to appreciate these leaves growing out of bark, love it! üçÉ

Royal Enfield Meteor‚õ∞Ô∏è is great, the sound of those cylinders banging is fricking amazing. Sadly it won't spare you from back pain from driving 6 hours continuous.

#### A day in my life involves some or all of the following
- Workout (if it wasn't for workout I wouldn't have understood how overpowered being consistent at something is)
- Coding (coding as in building something, not solving trivia and puzzles through code (leetcode yea you))
- Reading stuff people do on HackerNews, or reading case studies for challenges big orgs face from scaling systems to sharding database, everything
- Brainstorming about a side project/side hustles, working on them for weeks then and abandoning them midway and starting all over again lol and lmao xd
- Watching youtube, mainly UFC (Colby Covington is me but stronger), few OG youtubers (pewdiepie, KSI...), gaming (tbh it has felt more like a chore these days, don't enjoy it as much as I used to back in college), people building projects (StuffMadeHere, Mark Rober, NetworkChuck, primeagen, more CS related channels that actually build stuff rather than redundant tutorials), music (indie, indian hip-hop, hip-hop)


# It my work
Here's my workstation

Macbook Air M1 2020, Dell monitor, GTX 1060 3GB, 16 GB mem, Ryzen 3 1400, Logitech G102, potato keyboard, the photo is from a Realme Narzo 20 Pro

I typically spend 12 hrs of my day here, taking short breaks/walks to hydrate, hangout with family, also to avoid my hamstrings from getting super tight. If you are not taking short walks or stretches every 30 mins or so, I suggest you do it ASAP, lower back pain can ruin your life, [here's some motivation](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/vlsf9g/young_people_fuck_life_goals_and_take_care_of)!
The mousepad doubles as my gaming setup once I remove my Macbook with mouse and keyboard.

I manage my life at hourly level (whenever I can) using Notion, here's a screen snap of how a typical day looks like, this has all of my tasks assigned on hourly level, with it's own pomodoro trackers to make sure I'm on time, it's a bit of a chore hence it gets hard to stick to the schedule at times, but hey I'm improving each day.

Apart from this I spend most of my time on VSCode and I have heavily customized it to fit my needs, it looks beautiful and has a ton of custom key bindings that help me shred through any code blazingly fast, here's how it looks in it's full glory. Beautiful! Isn't it?

I am hungry for knowledge which is why I read a bunch of stuff daily (not books, mainly online content) and whenever the need arises I document it as personal notes in Obsidian, here's my second brain that contains all the stuff I've read and learned about the stock market and a bunch of complicated open source projects that I felt the need to take notes of.

#### That's all for now folks, I'll keep sharing stuff about my life here as I grow older.
