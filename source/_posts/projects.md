## Open Source

### [pack CLI](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack)
[pack](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack) is used to build OCI images from your apps source code automatically without the need to write any docker config files.
I was responsible for implementing new cache flags and a new cache type: bind cache support to speed up the build process during subsequent builds.
